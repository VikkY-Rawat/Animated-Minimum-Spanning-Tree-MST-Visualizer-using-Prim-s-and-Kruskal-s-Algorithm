# Animated-Minimum-Spanning-Tree-MST-Visualizer-using-Prim-s-and-Kruskal-s-Algorithm
The “Animated Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Visualizer using Prim’s and Kruskal’s Algorithm” is a Python-based educational project designed to help users understand how MST algorithms work through real-time visual animation.

The project generates a random connected weighted graph and allows the user to select between Prim’s or Kruskal’s Algorithm using a dropdown menu. When the algorithm is executed, the program animates the process of building the MST step-by-step — highlighting selected edges in different colors and showing updates of the total MST cost.

It is built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface, NetworkX for graph generation, and Matplotlib for visualization. The project also includes a “Save Graph” feature, allowing the user to save the final MST as an image file for reports or presentations.

This tool provides a clear, interactive, and engaging way to learn about greedy algorithms and how they differ in their approach to solving the Minimum Spanning Tree problem.
